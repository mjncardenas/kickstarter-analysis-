# kickstarter-analysis-
Performing analysis on a kickstarter data to uncover trends!

#Introduction:
The project involves looking at Louise’s fundraiser campaigns. Our job is to identify how to help Louise in her future fundraiser campaigns.  The Excel document portrays each fundraiser she did, the outcome of each fundraiser, the number of donors, the goal amount for each fundraiser, pledged amount, the type of fundraiser and the country the fundraiser was done. The goal of the project is to identify how to help Louise for future projects

###Challenge
Findings:
-Looking at the “Kickstarter” spreadsheet, the most successful fundraisers are plays. According the “Parent Category Chart,” it shows that theatre and plays have the most success rate. There were 412 successful fundraisers that were in done in plays alone. Other Successful fundraisers were done in the music/rock and film and documentaries.

-I have also found that the best goal to have for fundraisers are between $10,000 to $14,999. As the chart “Outcome Based on Goals” show the highest successful fundraisers are between $10,000 and $14,000. The second most successful goal. reached is less than $1000. There were also about 180 fundraisers that were successful between $5000 and $9,999.

-Time of when to fundraise is an important matter as well. Looking at the “Outcomes Based on Launch Date” line graph, the best time to fundraise in quarter 2. The worst time to fundraise in quarter 4. The reason for that is quarter 4 is the holiday season. Many people are purchasing gifts for their family members and will not have money to donate to fundraisers.

Recommendations:
-Looking at the findings, Louise should be conducting most of her fundraisers in theatre/plays venues. She should also have fundraisers in music/rock and film and documentaries venues. She should have them her as well because these venues have a high success rate in successful goals. 

-	In addition to having fundraisers in theatres, rock concerts, and in documentaries, Louise’s goal should not be so high. Her most successful goals reached were between $10,000 and $14,000. Therefore, I think that Louise should have more fundraisers that have goal that is around $14,000. This goal is more likely to be successful. 

-	In addition to the type of fundraisers and goal, time is also important. According to the “Outcomes Based on Launch Date” line graph, the best time to fundraise is between April and September. This is the best time because donors, will have the money to spend. In quarter 4, people are trying to purchase gifts for family and friend. This means that they do not have extra money to donate. The first quarter is not a good time because people are trying to pay off bills.
